            <h2>About Me</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>I like to think of myself as an energetic, creative, empathetic, and intellectually curious teacher and writer[cite: 102]. [cite_start]I have a PhD in English [cite: 103, 127][cite_start], and for the last thirty years, I have taught various English, humanities, developmental writing, reading, integrated reading and writing, critical thinking, and college success courses[cite: 103]. [cite_start]I've been involved in online teaching since 1999 [cite: 104][cite_start], and have designed and taught courses online every year since then[cite: 105]. [cite_start]I've authored several textbooks published by McGraw Hill [cite: 106] [cite_start]and have spoken nationally on topics related to teaching in higher education, focusing on creating engagement and deep learning in online courses[cite: 107].</p>
