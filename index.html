            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>I like to think of myself as an energetic, creative, empathetic, and intellectually curious teacher and writer. I have a PhD in English, and for the last thirty years, I have taught every English course offered at my college, as well as humanities, developmental writing, developmental reading, integrated reading and writing, critical thinking, and college success courses.</p>
            <p>I've been part of the online teaching movement since 1999, developing my first online course. I've designed and taught courses online (hybrid/blended, synchronous, asynchronous, in HTML / Blackboard / Canvas / BrightSpace) every year since then. I've written several textbooks (all published by McGraw Hill), written volumes of supplemental activities and tests for McGraw Hill Connect, and spoken nationally on topics relevant to teaching in higher education, especially creating engagement and deep learning in online courses.</p>
